## Program  
The program is a custom project built for Unit COS10009 at Swinburne University.
It is a spin off game of Snake that involves a rectangular snake moving to collect points on a grid.
The catch is in this game the keys reverse after collecting a star. 
As the game progress, you move faster giving less time to take controll of your ever changin key bindings.
